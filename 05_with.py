WITH STATEMENT
The best way to open and close the file automaticaly is the with statement.

# Open the file in read mode using 'with', which automatically closes the file
with open("this.txt", "r") as f:
# Read the contents of the file
    text = f.read()

# Print the contents
print(text)
'''

f= open("file.txt")
print(f.read())
f.close()

# The same can be written using with statement like this:
with open("file.txt") as f:
    print(f.read())

# You dont have to explicitly close the file
